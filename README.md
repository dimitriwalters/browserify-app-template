# browserify-template

A starter template to create a web application using Browserify.

Don't forget to install Browserify:

`npm install -g browserify`

To run the code I currently have, please also install `uniq`:

`npm install uniq`

And finally, don't forget to tell Browserify to handle your dependencies:

`browserify scripts/main.js -o scripts/bundle.js`
